1. Obtain the name of the .dsk image from the command-line (like: python my_script.py my_disk_image.dsk)
2. For each driver:
    a. File offset
    b. List the name of the driver
    c. Whether it's char or block device
    d. Manufacturer id
    e. Version number

If it were to print it all on one line, delimited with commas or something, it might help later when it's used to troll through a directory.

So maybe:

$ python my_script.py my_disk_image.dsk
